Cost_scaling_Factor = if increased, reduces the obstacle inflation and vice versa

sim_time = length of trajectory to be calculated. The higher the sim time the more trajectory is calculated. Not ideal for longer paths. 

sim_granularity = the step size to take between points on a trajectory. the smaller the better. Better resolution. But can be tuned.

Vx, Vy, Vth = sample rate for collecting velocity dont touch these, navigation crashed on virtual machine. Keep at 1. 

planner_Frequency = The rate in hz to run the planning loop.

controller_frequency = the rate in hz to run the control loop and send velocity commands to base.

planner_patience = (seconds) how long the planner will wait to determine a plan before beginning space clearing operations

controller_patience = seconds, how long the controller will wait without receiving valid controls.

update_Frequency = the frequency to update the map
publish_frequency = the frequency to publish the map data.
